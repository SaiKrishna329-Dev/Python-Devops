## Dictionaries

- A dictonary is created using `{'key': 'value'}` pair structure
- Keys should always be of immutable datatype such as tuple, strings, numbers etc
- In dictonaries, the order in which the elements are inserted is retained
- Nested dict:

  ```python
  sample_dict = {
    "employee": {
        "name": "John",
        "age": 30,
        "city": "New York"
    }
  }
  ```

### Methods in dict

- `keys()`
- `values()`
- `items()`
